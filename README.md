### 2️⃣ Tenure vs Churn

- Customers with shorter tenure exhibit significantly higher churn rates.
- Long-tenure customers demonstrate greater stability and retention.

This suggests that the first few months of the customer lifecycle are critical for retention strategies. Early engagement and onboarding improvements may reduce churn.

### 3️⃣ Contract Type vs Churn

- 📌 **Month-to-Month Contract:** 42.7% churn rate  
- 📌 **One-Year Contract:** 11.3% churn rate  
- 📌 **Two-Year Contract:** 2.8% churn rate  

Customers on month-to-month contracts are substantially more likely to churn compared to those on long-term contracts.  
This indicates that contract commitment plays a major role in customer retention.

## 🔥 Key Insights

- 📌 **Contract Type** is the strongest categorical predictor of churn.  
  Month-to-month customers exhibit significantly higher churn rates compared to long-term contract customers.

- 📊 **Tenure** is the strongest numerical predictor.  
  Customers within their first year are substantially more likely to churn.

- 💰 **Monthly Charges** show a weak positive correlation with churn, indicating that higher pricing slightly increases churn risk.

- 🌐 **Fiber Optic Customers** demonstrate elevated churn rates, potentially due to pricing sensitivity or service expectations.

- 🎯 The highest-risk segment consists of short-tenure customers on month-to-month contracts.


## 📈 Business Recommendations

- 🚀 Strengthen onboarding and engagement strategies during the first 12 months to reduce early-stage churn.

- 🔄 Incentivize migration from month-to-month to long-term contracts through loyalty programs and financial benefits.

- 💡 Implement targeted retention strategies for high-paying customers to mitigate price sensitivity.

- 🔍 Conduct service quality assessments for fiber optic customers and enhance support mechanisms to improve satisfaction.
